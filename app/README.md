## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User can interact with the app through gestures
* [ ] Displays ambient temperature and air pressure readings using device sensors.
* [ ] Implements a gesture playground where users can experiment with various gesture controls.
* [ ] Offers a dynamic log that records and displays gesture movements and interactions.

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* Integration of additional sensors to provide a wider range of environmental data.
* Enhanced gesture recognition for more complex interactions.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had issues with publishing the app on Google Play-- I reached out to the professor a while back 
expressing my reasoning for not publishing on Google Play yet I got no response. I was told by a TA 
it was okay to just submit the GitHub and take the points off for not submitting on Google Play.
